## Step 1
Get annoyed at streaming services removing content that you have as a dvd. The whole point of streaming services was so that you didn't have to get your ass off the couch to watch a movie. 

Install [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/en-ca/media-server-downloads/) on your NAS in order to stream your dvd rips you totally made yourself. 

## Step 2
Grow fed-up with how bad internet tracking is, and how slow it makes every website, and decide to shift from a software solution like UBlock Origin to a hardware solution. 

Buy a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/), learn to install it as headless device next to your router. You can only access it over ssh. Solve all those problems, install [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/), learn how to set it up to auto-update block lists. Be forced to log in once in a while to update it. 

The Pi-hole RPI is named Piholio, btw. 

## Step 3
Tire of relying on friends to provide ZNC bouncers, because you are still on irc like an old weirdo. Set up another Raspberry Pi, but since it's going to be internet facing, also learn to configure Linux to auto-update and apply security patches. 

## Step 4
Disallusioned with Spotify and worried about the future of Bandcamp, download your entire music library and set it up to stream to yourself with Plex. Find out that Plex doesn't work behind your NAS's VPN for external streaming, so setup a new instance of Plex on your internet-facing RPI. Learn how to mount samba shares. 

## Step 5
Be so angry at the state of your drivers on your Dell laptop, which are forced down your throat by Windows Update, whether you like it or not, that you decide to give [Ubuntu 22.04](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop) a try. 

Find out that you can pretty much do anything you would normally do in Windows, including playing games, in Linux thanks to Steam and [Proton](https://www.protondb.com/). Realize it's been four days and you haven't had any urge to go back to Windows. 

## Step 6
Discover that while you still need Windows for certain things, you find it to be a significantly worse day-to-day experience. 

Congratulations, you've become A Linux Guy.
