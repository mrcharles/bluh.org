There are enough people who are going to be at PTG that I felt it was useful to put my attendance plan somewhere shareable. 

Not sure yet if I'll hit The Garrison Thursday. TBD. 

## Friday May 31st

### 9pm - The Garrison

40 Watt Sun
Emma Ruth Rundle

## Saturday June 1st

### 4:30pm - Lee's Palace

## Sunday June 2nd
