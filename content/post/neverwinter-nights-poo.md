Neverwinter Nights 2 is the prime example of what happens when you give a bunch of green developers a big game to do, with not enough people and/or time. Say what you will about the first game, at least it had a level of polish to it. NWN2 is an object lesson in poor design.

I want to like it. I really do. Maybe after an upgrade. And about twelve patches.

I think it's time for Obsidian to stop getting work.
