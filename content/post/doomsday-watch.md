I've been sitting on the doomsday.watch domain name for some years now, and recently I started keeping track of the interesting articles I read in a month. The idea being, I suppose, to keep track of things so I have them around if I want to refer to them again, so I'm not just scrolling back through discord channels or whatever to find links. But also I use it as a kind of filter for what I think is actually worthwhile vs not. 

Since I had all these links around, and I had the domain, and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is so easy to use, I figured I'd put them into a kind of monthly link post so that I could share them with the none of you who read this blog. 

So I present [Doomsday.Watch](https://doomsday.watch), a site for monthly summaries of filtered doom content. Full of climate and tech doom, free of political and war doom. I find the latter are truly bad for my mental health, but the former are just... well, cathartic for weird personal reasons. If this appeals to you, I do hope you enjoy(?) it.
