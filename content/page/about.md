I’m a professional game developer with over 20 years of experience, mostly in AAA. I specialize in player controls and player systems, design, and leading teams. On the side I play guitar, write about music, and constantly start small games I never finish. I love to talk about games, my job, and the industry.

If you’d like to contact me, my email is simply charles dot mylastname at gmail dot com.
