# 2021 - Current

It's a secret. 

# 2016 - 2020: Watch Dogs: Legion

Lead Gameplay Programmer. It was an impossible project, but my team still managed to knock it out of the park.

# 2012 - 2016: Below

Gameplay Programmer. Nathan called me Lead Gameplay Programmer once, but I think he was joking. I programmed most of the gameplay outside of the UI and level generation. 

# 2010 - 2012: Ubisoft Toronto Founding + Splinter Cell: Blacklist

Additional Gameplay Programming, because I left before the game shipped.

One of the OG Ubi Toronto employees brought over from Montreal. 

# 2007 - 2009: Assassin's Creed 2

Technical Team Lead: Combat. Cleaned up the design and rebuilt everything from scratch to make it more better.

# 2005 - 2007: Assassin's Creed

Behavior Programmer: Combat & Assassination. I went rogue and added air assassination even though it was cut. You're welcome, Ubisoft. 

# 2001 - 2005: Pariah

This is a bad game, so don't play it, but if for some reason you do, I'm still proud of the ladders. They are the best ladders in any first person game. 

# 1999 - 2001: The Bioware Blur

MDK2, Baldur's Gate 2, MDK2: Armageddon, NWN, KOTOR, I squished four years of work into two and a half years of real time. Because of death marches.
